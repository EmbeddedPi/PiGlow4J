# PiGlow4J
Java package for controlling the PiGlow board on the Raspberry Pi.

This package provides multiple layers of control for the PiGlow board.
The first layer of control allows for direct control of each LED on the board.
The second layer provides an animation framework where all of the timing is managed by PiGlow4J.

This package requires Java 8. It also has a dependency on Pi4J package that provides access to the Raspberry Pi's I2C  functions.
